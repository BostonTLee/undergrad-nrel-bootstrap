# Group 2 Meeting notes

## 11/17/2021

- Boston got an API key, hasn't pulled any data
    - Interested in solar irradiance and wind speed data
    - Paper indicates LA data from 1991 to 2010 was used
    - Fort Collins could be done after LA as our "extension" of the project
- Each node (or household) should be an instance of a defined class - use python for OOP capabilities
- PV droop controller should be written as a helper function
- Goals:
    - Adam: Figure out the test case model, and list what attributes, functions, etc. might be needed
    - Evan: Figure out the PV system model and see how it is used in each test case
    - Boston: Use the API or website to get a more-or-less complete
    data set; if that gets done, do a Kernel Density Estimate
