# Group 2 Meeting notes

## 11/17/2021

- Boston got an API key, hasn't pulled any data
- Goals:
    - Adam: Figure out the test case model, and list what attributes, functions, etc. might be needed
    - Evan: Figure out the PV system model and see how it is used in each test case
    - Boston: Use the API or website to get a more-or-less complete
    data set; if that gets done, do a Kernel Density Estimate
